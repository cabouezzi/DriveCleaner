# DriveCleaner
Python script to go through files from personal Google Drive and copy them locally and delete them from Drive. It moved 12GB of storage from my Google Drive, and deleted half of which were duplicate files.
<br><br>__Note__: Running the script alone won't work. Google Drive's API requires registering your app in the cloud console
